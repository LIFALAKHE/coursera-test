            Moët & Chandon Brut Imperial is not a very expensive Champagne,
            relative to prices of some Prestige Cuvée Champagnes for example.
            Yet, it's not the most affordable either. My personal opinion is
            that you get a good Champagne for the price you pay when you buy
            Moët Imperial, and you have the advantage of consistency.Soon after
            its foundation, and after son Claude-Louis joined Moët et Cie, the
            winery's clientele included nobles and aristocrats. In 1833, the
            company was renamed Moët et Chandon after Pierre-Gabriel Chandon de
            Briailles, Remy Moët's son-in-law, joined the company as a partner
            of Jean-Remy Moët, Claude Moët's grandson.[4] Following the
            introduction of the concept of a vintage champagne in 1840, Moët
            marketed its first vintage in 1842. Their best-selling brand, Brut
            Imperial, was introduced in the 1860s. Their best known label, Dom
            Perignon, is named for the Benedictine monk remembered in legend as
            the "Father of Champagne".

            (Louis-Vuitton-Moët-Hennessy), the largest luxury group in the
            world, netting over 16 billion euros in fiscal 2004. Moët & Chandon
            holds a royal warrant as supplier of champagne to Queen Elizabeth
            II.[5][3][6] In 2006, Moët et Chandon Brut Impérial issued an
            extremely limited bottling of its champagne named "Be Fabulous", a
            special release of its original bottle with decorative Swarovski

            article: Dom Pérignon (wine) Dom Pérignon (/ˌdɒmpɛrɪˈnjɒn/; French
            pronunciation: ​[dɔ̃peʁiɲɔ̃]) is a brand of champagne produced by Moët
            & Chandon. It is named after Dom Pierre Pérignon, a Benedictine monk
            who was an important quality pioneer for Champagne wine but who,
            contrary to popular myths, did not discover the champagne method for
            making sparkling wines.[7] Dom Pérignon was the first prestige
            cuvée, an idea proposed by Englishman Laurence Venn.[8] The first
            vintage of Dom Pérignon was 1921
